# Citibike Data Analysis

## Overview
In this analysis, we look into bikesharing data recorded in New York City. Our goal is to solidify a buisness proposal by showing our investors visualizations of our bike trip analysis. We use the Python library, Pandas, to clean and organize the data we need for analysis. We then use Tableau to create visual story of our findings in the data.
 
## Results
Using the 7 visualizations, we have determined multiple business plans that can ensure a successful company. These visualizations can be followed through my [Tableau dashboard link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yubi.quinzon/viz/Bikeshare_16540523049430/CitibikeAnalysis?publish=yes).

Throughout the data, we clearly see that Males tend to use the buissness significantly more than the other genders. Using this information, we can assume the types of use that the bikes would most commonly be under. For example, Males tends to be more reckless than the other genders. We can conclude that having more durable bikes will benefit the company over time as they would be able to withstand the expected abuse. This would help cut cost on repairs/replacements/etc.
